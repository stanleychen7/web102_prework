## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- A challenge I faced was trying to understand ternary operations. At first, it was hard to wrap my head around the concept and figuring out the syntax. However, I just thought of it
as a basic if-else statement and was able to implement it. Other than that, I just had to make a few minor changes after each checkpoint to make sure my website was displaying the expected result. Overall a fun and refreshing experience in web dev.
